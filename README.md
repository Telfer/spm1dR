# spm1dR

One-Dimensional Statistical Parametric Mapping in R.

This package is based on the spm1d python package developed by Todd Pataky (https://spm1d.org/).

spm1d uses Random Field Theory expectations regarding the behavior of smooth, one-dimensional Gaussian fields to make statistical inferences regarding a set of one-dimensional continua.

## Installation

You can install the development version of spm1dR from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("Telfer/spm1dR")
```
