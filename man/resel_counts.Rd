\title{Calculate resel counts for 1D field}
\usage{
resel_counts(data, fwhm, element_based = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{1D data (vector or matrix), or binary mask}

\item{fwhm}{Full-Width at Half-Maximum}

\item{element_based}{if TRUE, use element-based resels}
}
\value{
vector of resel counts
}
\description{
Calculate resel counts for 1D field
}
\details{
Resels (resolution elements) are the number of independent observations
in a smooth random field. For 1D fields:
resels = (number of nodes - 1) / FWHM

This matches the Python spm1d implementation exactly.
